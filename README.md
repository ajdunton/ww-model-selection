# ww-model-selection

This repository includes code for simulating the effect of damage to wastewater network components on the functionality of the network. Specifically, two methods are used for assessing the functionality, with two corresponding scripts here:
* flow.py: uses flow analysis (specifically SWMM) for functionality assessment
* connectivity.py: uses connectivity analysis for functionality assessment

# Specifying the Damage Probabilities
